# Golang Coding Exercises

Hi!

Here i'll be uploading Golang exercises from coding interviews I've found -and possibly had failed- (specially in said cases, since this is more than anything else a place for me to learn from my mistakes).

## List of Exercises:
### - **Validate Brackets Sequence**:
First exercise I worked with is the *'Validate Brackets Sequence'*, which essentially consist on verifying if a closing bracket ")", "]", "}" corresponds to the last openning one found on a given string and returning a boolean in either case.

### Example:
Given the string "([{}]]" would return true whereas the string "([}]]" would return false, since ']' is not paired with '{'.

Note: Each exercise will be a separated Golang package, while the *main.go* file will remain as a playground for showing purpuses.

Thanks!
